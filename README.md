This project is based off of [DetourXS](https://github.com/sekoyo/detourxs) v2 by Dominic Tobias. I later converted it to pure C and changed the length disassembler from BeaEngine's LDE32/LDE64 (Length Disassembler Engine 32/64) to HDE32/HDE64 (Hacker Disassembler Engine 32/64) by Vyacheslav Patkov because LDE sometimes gave me incorrect length for some functions while HDE was always accurate.
